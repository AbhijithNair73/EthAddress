# EthAddress
EthAddress is a clone of bitaddress.org.
You will be able to generate Private-Public Key pair.
Also Generates Ethereum Address for provided public key. I found it difficult to get the etherum address from the public key. Such a feature is not even available in 
Etherscan. So I decided to build an application to do the same.

Steps to clone and use.
