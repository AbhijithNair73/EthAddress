# EthAddress
EthAddress is an attempt to make a clone of bitaddress.org for generating ethereum wallet. It is a complete javascript client code.
It can create a ethereum account from the seed generated by mousemovement as it is in bitaddress.org. QR code for ethereum is also generated and can be downloaded as png file.
Also, It can generate ethereum address from the provided public key, no need to provide private key, hence ensuring security.

Motivation:
I found it difficult to get the etherum address from the public key. Such a feature is not even available in 
Etherscan. So I decided to build an application to do the same and then kept on upgrading it.

Future Ideas & Plan:
To make it a ethereum crypto wallet with tokens
  - User login and database management
  - Highly secure
