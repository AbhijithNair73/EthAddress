# EthAddress
EthAddress is a clone of bitaddress.org.
You will be able to generate Private-Public Key pair.
Also Generates Ethereum Address for provided public key. I found it difficult to get the etherum address from the public key. Such a feature is not even available in 
Etherscan. So I decided to build an application to do the same.



Use below way to execute browserify
node .\node_modules\browserify\bin\cmd.js js\mouse.js > js\bundle2.js
Steps to clone and use.

Future Ideas & Plan:
To make it a ethereum crypto wallet with tokens
  - User login and database management
  - Highly secure
  - Get the feed from mousemovement as bitaddress.org and then use it as a seed to generate private key
